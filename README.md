# Techno Fomo

Techno Fomo serves as external storage for my brain to remember innovative technology.
It is a system of record to write down when I discover something interesting that I
will want to recall N months from now.

Techno Fomo is hosted as a [GitHub pages site](https://mspiegel.github.io/technofomo).
